# Calculator Unit Testing

This project demonstrates the process of writing unit tests for a basic calculator application. The calculator supports the following operations: addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. The unit tests are written using the JUnit framework to validate the correctness of these operations.

## Calculator Methods

The `Calculator` class includes the following methods:

- **add(double... numbers)**: Adds a list of numbers.
- **multiply(double... numbers)**: Multiplies a list of numbers.
- **subtract(double... numbers)**: Subtracts numbers in sequence (starting from the first number).
- **divide(double... numbers)**: Divides numbers in sequence (starting from the first number).

## Unit Tests

Unit tests are written in the `CalculatorTest.java` file and include test cases for each operation. The test cases validate whether the `Calculator` class methods work as expected. The test cases cover various scenarios including normal cases, edge cases, and exceptions.
